We use a custom json web token in our 
asp.net trying to create a security system from
scratch. Here we are using a traditional jwt authorization

1 after the client logs in they are assigned with a jwt token
2 the jwt token includes some information like 
client role, username, expirey date
2 the assigned jwt will get expired after some
time intervial 
3 we are doing a long poling to renew the 
jwt token before it expires 
4 since we are using a client site framework 
(react) which needs seprate configuration to
secure UI or pages from only authorized user
5 the jwt token or access token is renewed
with the help of refresh token which has a long 
expirey date then access token probally for like
days. So as long as user has a valid refreh token
they can refresh their access token
